/**
 * Pure-decision-function tests for [LiteRtProvider]'s image-forwarding gate.
 *
 * [decideImageForwarding] guards against a hard native crash. When a vision-capable model is
 * loaded but the device's GPU vision executor fails to initialise, [LiteRtRuntime.ensureLoaded]
 * falls back to a TEXT-ONLY engine (see [LiteRtRuntime.LoadOutcome.visionEnabled] /
 * [LiteRtRuntime.LoadOutcome.visionFellBackToTextOnly]). Forwarding image bytes to an engine
 * that has no vision executor null-derefs inside `liblitertlm_jni.so` -> SIGSEGV. The gate
 * MUST therefore key off the ACTUAL post-load vision state, never the pre-load estimate (which
 * is still `true` at the moment of the doomed first load).
